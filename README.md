## About The Project

This game was created for a class assignment in my 2nd year of software engineering. We were given a frame work of what the program would look like and do, but it was up to us to build the actual application. Many students did not end up completing the program or resorted to using the code provided by the professor after each assignment. All of the code you see here is a result of my own work.

The game works as follows, a map of random symbols are loaded and the program translate that into a map. The user then can move around the map as directed with the NWSE keys, depending on what paths are open. Each path leads to different mini caves, each of which houses different kinds of monsters.

Overall, I learned a great deal from this project and I really enjoyed how the assignments built on top of one another. This project really stretched my understanding of object oriented programming since it incorporated concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
